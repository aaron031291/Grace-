# Grace ‚Äî Production Readiness Status (PowerWell View)
**Snapshot:** 2025-10-03 (Europe/London)

---

## High-level
- ‚úÖ **This is a real running system, not placeholders.**  
  Verified by earlier logs:  
  - API responding (`/health 200`, `/metrics 200`)  
  - Workers consuming queues  
  - Prometheus scraping targets  
  - Grafana dashboards live  
  - Postgres and Redis persisting state  
  - Qdrant reachable and ready for vectors  
  Placeholders wouldn‚Äôt do this.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Not yet production-hardened.**  
  Gaps: resilience, security edge, CI/CD hard gates, DR/backup drill, idempotency & DLQ, tracing, runbooks. Redis logs also showed warnings (overcommit/AOF) that need tuning.

## Subsystem Scorecard

| Subsystem | Status | % | Verified by logs / behavior | Missing for 100% |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| API & HTTP Edge | ‚úÖ Running | **85%** | `/health 200`, `/metrics 200` | Global rate-limit, full schema validation, idempotency keys, standardized error envelope, TLS termination config |
| Workers & Queues | ‚úÖ Processing | **82%** | Workers consuming queues; retries observed | DLQ + replay tooling, idempotent handlers, bounded concurrency, poison-pill detection, queue metrics |
| Datastores (Postgres/Redis/Qdrant) | ‚úÖ Healthy | **88%** | Postgres & Redis stateful; Qdrant ready | Postgres PITR + snapshot cron, Redis AOF + `vm.overcommit_memory=1`, Qdrant snapshot policy, pool limits & breakers |
| Security (authn/z, secrets) | ‚ö†Ô∏è Ok-ish | **62%** | JWT/RBAC scaffolding | Role matrix tests, short-TTL + refresh tokens, secrets via env/vault, CSP/HSTS headers, dep/image scans |
| CI/CD | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | **72%** | Workflows exist; builds run | E2E in CI, coverage ‚â•80% gate, SAST/dep scan, image signing, staged promotion |
| Observability | ‚úÖ Good base | **80%** | Prometheus+Grafana live | SLOs & alert rules, OpenTelemetry traces, structured logs, fire-drill validation |
| Reliability & Ops | ‚ö†Ô∏è Nearly there | **78%** | Health checks, restarts | Blue/green deploy, shadow compare, auto-rollback on SLO burn, DR runbook |
| Docs & Runbooks | ‚ùó Needs love | **58%** | Base READMEs | One-hour setup guide, prod runbook, on-call checklist, updated arch diagram |
| Performance & Cost | ‚ö†Ô∏è Lightly tested | **70%** | Baseline perf OK | Load tests (k6/Locust), perf SLOs, capacity model, cost dashboards, cache policy |
| ML Layer (if prod) | üí§ Optional | **50%** | Mock OK | Model registry, drift/canary eval, feature IO tests, batching/limits |

## What‚Äôs Complete (verified)
- **End-to-end boot works**: services up, containers connected, health checks passed.
- **API online**: `/health 200`, `/metrics 200` from logs.
- **Queues operational**: workers consuming; retries/backoff visible.
- **Metrics stack**: Prometheus scraping, Grafana dashboards live.
- **Stateful services**: Postgres, Redis, Qdrant healthy and persisting.
- **Migrations**: Alembic framework present and runnable.
- **CI present**: GitHub Actions workflows exist and build/test containers.
- **Governance scaffolding**: policy contract, examples, watchdog present.

## What Isn‚Äôt Done (yet)
1. **Security edge** ‚Üí rate limiting, auth everywhere, JWT short-TTL + refresh, CSP/HSTS headers, secret rotation.
2. **Idempotency & DLQ** ‚Üí idempotency keys on mutating endpoints, handler fingerprints, per-queue DLQ with replay.
3. **Backups & Restore** ‚Üí Postgres PITR + snapshots, Redis AOF/overcommit tune, Qdrant snapshot policy, full DR rehearsal.
4. **Tracing & Alerts** ‚Üí OpenTelemetry spans, golden SLOs, tested alert rules.
5. **Blue/green rollout** ‚Üí shadow compare + rollback trigger.
6. **CI/CD gates** ‚Üí ‚â•80% coverage, Bandit, pip-audit, Trivy, image signing, staged promotion.
7. **Docs/Runbooks** ‚Üí one-hour setup, prod runbook, on-call guide, updated architecture diagram.
8. **Perf & Cost** ‚Üí k6/Locust scripts, perf SLOs, capacity model, cost dashboards.

## TODO Map (assign and check off)

### API & Edge
- [ ] Add global rate-limit middleware (per-IP + token bucket)
- [ ] Enforce Pydantic request/response schemas on all routes
- [ ] Standardize error envelope (code, message, trace_id)
- [ ] Implement idempotency keys on all mutating endpoints
- [ ] TLS termination config (envoy/nginx/ingress)

### Workers & Queues
- [ ] Idempotent handlers (fingerprint/dedupe)
- [ ] DLQ per queue + replay CLI
- [ ] Poison-pill detection (quarantine after max retries)
- [ ] Bounded concurrency per queue
- [ ] Emit job metrics (success, latency, fail, retries)

### Datastores
- [ ] Postgres: PITR base backups + WAL archiving; nightly snapshots
- [ ] Redis: enable AOF; set `vm.overcommit_memory=1`
- [ ] Qdrant: snapshot/export policy + restore doc
- [ ] Pool limits/timeouts; circuit breakers on clients

### Security
- [ ] Role matrix tests for RBAC
- [ ] JWT short-TTL access + refresh flow
- [ ] Secrets via env/vault only; redact logs
- [ ] CSP, HSTS, referrer policy headers
- [ ] CI SAST (Bandit), dep scan (pip-audit), image scan (Trivy)

### CI/CD
- [ ] Add e2e tests (`demo_and_tests/e2e/`)
- [ ] Enforce coverage ‚â•80%
- [ ] Image signing (cosign)
- [ ] Staged promotion dev‚Üístaging‚Üíprod with approval

### Observability
- [ ] Wire OpenTelemetry traces API‚Üíworker‚ÜíDB
- [ ] Commit golden SLOs + alert rules
- [ ] Add fire-drill script to test alerts ‚Üí on-call

### Reliability & Ops
- [ ] Implement blue/green deploy with shadow traffic
- [ ] Auto-rollback on SLO regression
- [ ] DR runbook + rehearsal checklist

### Docs
- [ ] `docs/ONE_HOUR_SETUP.md`
- [ ] `docs/PROD_RUNBOOK.md`
- [ ] `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` kept current

## Summary
- **Already complete**: Boot + health, API, queues, stateful stores, monitoring dashboards, CI scaffolding, governance scaffolding.
- **Missing 10‚Äì15%**: Security hardening, backups, DLQ/idempotency, tracing/SLOs, blue/green rollout, CI gates, docs/runbooks.
- **Effort estimate**: 2‚Äì3 weeks focused work for one engineer ‚Üí full production readiness.
