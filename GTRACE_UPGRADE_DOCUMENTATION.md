## Architecture

### Core Classes

#### `GraceTracer`
The main tracing engine with full governance integration.

```python
tracer = await create_grace_tracer(
    event_bus=event_bus,
    memory_core=memory_core,
    immutable_logs=immutable_logs,
    kpi_monitor=kpi_monitor
)
```

#### `TraceChain`
Represents a complete trace sequence with constitutional validation.

#### `TraceEvent`
Individual events within a trace with vault compliance tracking.

#### `TraceMetadata`
Comprehensive metadata including vault compliance status.

### Vault Compliance Enums

```python
class VaultCompliance(Enum):
    VAULT_1_VERIFICATION = "verification_protocol"
    VAULT_2_CORRELATION = "correlation_tracking"
    VAULT_3_ROUTING = "intelligent_routing"
    # ... all 18 vaults
    VAULT_18_EVOLUTION = "adaptive_learning"
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Tracing with Constitutional Compliance

```python
# Start a governance-aware trace
trace_id = await tracer.start_trace(
    component_id="governance_component",
    operation="policy_evaluation",
    governance_required=True  # Triggers constitutional review
)

# Add events with decision narrative (Vault 12)
await tracer.add_trace_event(
    trace_id=trace_id,
    event_type="decision",
    operation="policy_decision",
    narrative="Policy approved after constitutional review. " +
             "High confidence due to strong governance alignment."
)

# Complete with constitutional validation
success = await tracer.complete_trace(trace_id, success=True)
```

### Decorator-Based Tracing

```python
@trace_operation(tracer, "component_id", "operation_name", governance_required=True)
async def critical_operation(data):
    # Function automatically traced with governance validation
    return process_data(data)
```

### Vault Compliance Checking

```python
status = await tracer.get_trace_status(trace_id)
vault_compliance = status['vault_compliance']

# Check specific vault compliance
if vault_compliance[VaultCompliance.VAULT_6_CONTRADICTION.value]:
    print("No contradictions detected")

if vault_compliance[VaultCompliance.VAULT_15_SANDBOX.value]:
    print("Sandbox isolation active")
```

## Integration with Grace Governance Kernel

The gtrace component is automatically integrated when initializing the Grace Governance Kernel:

```python
# Automatic gtrace integration
kernel = GraceGovernanceKernel(config)
await kernel.initialize()  # gtrace is automatically created and integrated
await kernel.start()

# Access integrated gtrace
gtrace = kernel.components['gtrace']
gtrace_status = kernel.get_gtrace_status()
```

### Governance Hooks

The gtrace component includes governance integration hooks:

- **Critical Trace Handler**: Routes high-impact traces to governance review
- **Contradiction Detector**: Detects policy and logical contradictions
- **Constitutional Validator**: Validates traces against constitutional principles

## Performance Metrics

The upgraded gtrace provides comprehensive metrics:

```python
metrics = tracer.get_system_metrics()
# Returns:
# {
#     'traces_created': int,
#     'traces_completed': int,
#     'traces_failed': int,
#     'governance_reviews': int,
#     'constitutional_violations': int,
#     'vault_compliance_rate': float,
#     'active_traces': int,
#     'completed_traces': int,
#     'components_traced': int
# }
```

## Constitutional Principles Validation

All traces undergo automatic validation against Grace's constitutional principles:

1. **Transparency**: Decision narratives and clear audit trails
2. **Fairness**: No contradictions or biased operations detected
3. **Accountability**: Component identification and responsibility tracking
4. **Consistency**: Logical consistency across trace operations
5. **Harm Prevention**: Security validation and risk assessment

## Error Handling and Recovery (Vault 16)
