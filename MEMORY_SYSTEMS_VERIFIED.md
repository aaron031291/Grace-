  - WebSocket support for real-time updates
  - Status dashboard widgets
  - Search interface


METRICS & MONITORING
====================

Performance Tracking:
  - Cache hit ratio
  - Cache miss ratio
  - Access logs (timestamp, operation, source)
  - Search result counts
  - Layer-specific statistics

Status Monitoring:
  - Lightning: initialized/active
  - Fusion: initialized/active
  - Vector: initialized/active
  - Librarian: initialized/active
  - Overall system health

Available via:
  - get_system_status()
  - get_memory_stats()
  - EventBus events
  - API endpoints


CONFIGURATION & INITIALIZATION
===============================

To initialize all memory systems:

  from grace.memory import UnifiedMemorySystem
  
  # Create unified system
  memory_system = UnifiedMemorySystem(event_bus, truth_layer)
  
  # Initialize all layers
  await memory_system.initialize_all_layers(
      lightning=lightning_memory,
      fusion=fusion_memory,
      vector=vector_memory,
      librarian=librarian_memory
  )
  
  # Verify all systems ready
  status = memory_system.get_system_status()


USAGE EXAMPLES
==============

Store data across all layers:
  await memory_system.store("key123", {"data": "value"})

Retrieve with automatic strategy:
  data = await memory_system.retrieve("key123", search_type="any")

Semantic search:
  results = await memory_system.search("query", search_type="semantic")

Check system health:
  stats = memory_system.get_system_status()
  print(stats)
