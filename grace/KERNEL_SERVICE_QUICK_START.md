Grace AI - Kernel & Service Repair - Quick Start
==============================================

WHAT'S BEEN FIXED SO FAR:
========================

✅ grace/core/service_registry.py
   - Replaces missing grace.core.unified_service
   - Provides DI container
   - Manages service lifecycle

✅ grace/kernels/base_kernel.py
   - Base class for all kernels
   - Consistent interface
   - Service integration

✅ main.py imports
   - Updated to use service_registry
   - Removed broken imports


WHAT STILL NEEDS FIXING:
=======================

Priority 1 (Critical - system won't work):
  ✗ grace/multi_os/MultiOSKernel (currently broken)
  ✗ Individual kernel implementations (currently placeholder loops)
  ✗ Unified launcher (currently missing)

Priority 2 (Important - incomplete functionality):
  ✗ Kernel-service wiring details
  ✗ Error handling in launchers
  ✗ Graceful shutdown

Priority 3 (Nice to have):
  ✗ Performance optimization
  ✗ Advanced logging
  ✗ Monitoring/metrics


TO VERIFY CURRENT STATE:
======================

Run verification:
  python verify_system.py

Expected output should show:
  ✓ Core Truth Layer
  ✓ Unified Memory System
  ✓ All Kernels
  ✓ Core Services
  ✓ Immune System
  ✓ AVN
  ✓ MCP Integration
  ✓ Consciousness System
  ✓ API Layer
  ✓ Database Models

Any failures point to remaining issues.


NEXT IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
=======================

1. Run verification:
   python verify_system.py

2. Check what's failing:
   - If imports fail: fix missing modules
   - If launcher fails: need unified launcher
   - If kernels fail: implement kernel classes

3. Implement in order:
   - MultiOSKernel
   - Unified launcher
   - Individual kernel implementations


MOST CRITICAL FIX NEEDED:
========================

The grace/multi_os/ module currently:
  - Only exports __version__
  - No MultiOSKernel class
  - Always fails when imported

FIX:
  Create grace/multi_os/core.py with:
    class MultiOSKernel(BaseKernel)

  Update grace/multi_os/__init__.py:
    from .core import MultiOSKernel
    __all__ = ['MultiOSKernel', '__version__']


THEN: UNIFIED LAUNCHER

The system needs a single entry point:
  grace/launcher.py or grace/run.py

Usage:
  python -m grace.launcher
  python -m grace.launcher --kernel learning
  python -m grace.launcher --debug


VERIFICATION SCRIPT:
===================

After each fix, run:
  python verify_system.py

This checks all imports and basic wiring.
Each successful test = one piece fixed.


ESTIMATED TIME TO FULL REPAIR:
==============================

With focused effort:
  - MultiOSKernel: 30 minutes
  - Unified launcher: 1 hour
  - Kernel implementations: 2-3 hours
  - Testing: 1 hour
  
  TOTAL: ~4-5 hours


SUPPORT:
========

For guidance on each phase:
  - KERNEL_SERVICE_COMPLETE_REPAIR_PLAN.md (detailed phases)
  - KERNEL_SERVICE_REPAIR_SUMMARY.md (what was fixed)
  - KERNEL_SERVICE_AUDIT.md (issues identified)

For verification:
  python verify_system.py
  python grace/diagnostics/wiring_audit.py


STATUS:
=======

✅ Infrastructure: READY (ServiceRegistry, BaseKernel)
✅ Imports: UPDATED (main.py fixed)
⚠️  Kernels: NEED IMPLEMENTATION
⚠️  Launcher: NEED CREATION
⚠️  Multi-OS: NEED FIX


RECOMMENDATION:
================

Start here:
  1. Run: python verify_system.py
  2. See what fails
  3. Fix one thing at a time
  4. Re-run verification
  5. Repeat until all green ✓

Then system will be:
  ✅ No placeholder loops
  ✅ Real kernel implementations
  ✅ Proper service integration
  ✅ Production-ready
