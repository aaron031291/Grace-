# Grace Governance Kernel

The **Grace Governance Kernel** is an advanced AI governance system that implements constitutional decision-making, multi-specialist consensus, and democratic oversight for AI systems. It provides tamper-proof audit trails, real-time health monitoring, and sophisticated trust management.

## Architecture Overview

Grace implements a comprehensive governance architecture with the following components:

### Core Governance Layer (`grace/governance/`)
- **Verification Engine** - Truth validation and claim analysis with constitutional reasoning
- **Unified Logic** - Cross-layer synthesis and arbitration of specialist inputs
- **Governance Engine** - Main orchestrator with policy enforcement and event management
- **Parliament** - Democratic review system for major decisions
- **Trust Core Kernel** - Trust and credibility weighting for sources and components

### Event Infrastructure (`grace/layer_02_event_mesh/`)
- **Trigger Mesh** - Sub-millisecond event routing with priority queues and constitutional validators

### Audit System (`grace/layer_04_audit_logs/` ‚Üí `grace/audit/`)
- **Immutable Logs** - Blockchain-like tamper-proof audit trail with transparency controls
- **Golden Path Auditor** - Concrete append/verify implementation for all memory operations
- **Accessible via**: `grace/audit/immutable_logs.py` (symlinked for convenience)

### Health Monitoring (`grace/immune/`)
- **Enhanced AVN Core** - Anomaly detection, predictive alerts, and automated healing

### ML/DL Consensus (`grace/mldl/`)
- **21-Specialist Quorum** - Expert consensus system with weighted voting
- **Governance Liaison** - Ensures ML/DL model compliance with constitutional principles

### Core Infrastructure (`core/`)
- **Event Bus** - Central event routing and correlation tracking
- **Memory Core** - Persistent storage with precedent-based reasoning
- **Contracts** - Shared data structures and type definitions

## Quick Start

### Automated Setup (Recommended)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aaron031291/Grace-.git
cd Grace-
./scripts/setup.sh
```

The setup script will automatically:
- Install Python and Git if needed (Linux/macOS)
- Create a virtual environment
- Install all dependencies
- Configure Git settings
- Set up development tools

### Manual Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aaron031291/Grace-.git
cd Grace-
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.template .env  # Edit with your configuration
```

### Basic Usage
```python
import asyncio
from grace.governance.grace_governance_kernel import GraceGovernanceKernel

async def main():
    # Initialize and start governance kernel
    kernel = GraceGovernanceKernel()
    await kernel.start()
    
    # Process a governance request
    result = await kernel.process_governance_request(
        "policy",  # decision type
        {
            "claims": [...],     # Claims to validate
            "context": {...}     # Decision context
        }
    )
    
    print(f"Decision: {result['outcome']}")
    await kernel.shutdown()

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Governance Enforcement Hooks

Grace provides runtime enforcement through several key components:

#### Constitutional Decorator
```python
from grace.governance.constitutional_decorator import constitutional_check

@constitutional_check(policy="strict", transparency_level="public")
async def sensitive_operation(data, rationale="Automated operation"):
    # Your sensitive operation here
    return {"result": "processed", "governance": {...}}
```

#### Trust Middleware
```python
from grace.governance.constitutional_decorator import trust_middleware

@trust_middleware(min_trust_score=0.8)
async def high_trust_operation(data):
    # Operation requiring high trust score
    return data
```

#### Golden Path Auditing
```python
from grace.audit.golden_path_auditor import append_audit

# In your API endpoints or operations:
audit_id = await append_audit(
    operation_type="memory_write",
    operation_data={"action": "data_ingestion"},
    user_id="user123",
    transparency_level="democratic_oversight"
)
```

#### Policy Enforcement Middleware
Applied automatically to all API routes in `grace.api.api_service`:
- Validates operations against policy rules
- Blocks unauthorized actions
- Logs policy violations
- Enforces constitutional compliance

## Development Workflow

Grace provides automated Git workflow tools to streamline development across environments:

### Git Workflow Helper
```bash
# Linux/macOS
./scripts/git-workflow.sh <command>

# Windows PowerShell
.\scripts\git-workflow.ps1 <command>
```

Common commands:
- `setup` - Configure Git settings
- `new-branch feature/my-feature` - Create new feature branch
- `workflow fix governance "fix validation bug"` - Complete workflow (test, commit, push)
- `sync` - Sync with main branch
- `status` - Show repository status
- `test` - Run tests

## Architecture Evolution

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Deprecation Notice**: The "layer_*" model references in older documentation are deprecated. 
> The current Grace architecture uses an **11-kernel structure** as the single source of truth:
> 
> - **Governance Kernel** - Constitutional decision-making
> - **Intelligence Kernel** - AI reasoning and validation  
> - **Learning Kernel** - Adaptive learning and improvement
> - **Memory Kernel** - Persistent storage and retrieval
> - **Trust Kernel** - Credibility and reliability management
> - **Interface Kernel** - User and system interfaces
> - **Orchestration Kernel** - Workflow coordination
> - **Resilience Kernel** - Health monitoring and recovery
> - **Ingress Kernel** - Data input and validation
> - **Multi-OS Kernel** - Cross-platform compatibility
> - **MLdL Kernel** - Machine learning specialists
>
> For legacy compatibility, some layer references remain but point to the kernel implementations.
