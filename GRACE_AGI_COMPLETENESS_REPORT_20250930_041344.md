## Recommended Next Steps

To advance towards true AGI capabilities:

1. Enhance consciousness implementation
2. Enhance reasoning implementation


## Conclusion

The Grace system demonstrates excellent architectural planning and modular design, 
indicating a sophisticated understanding of AGI requirements. However, the current 
implementation focuses primarily on governance and coordination frameworks rather 
than core AGI capabilities like consciousness, causal reasoning, and meta-cognition.

**Key Insight:** Grace is currently a high-quality AI governance framework positioned 
for AGI development rather than a functional AGI system.
