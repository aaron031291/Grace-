# Grace Governance Kernel

The **Grace Governance Kernel** is an advanced AI governance system that implements constitutional decision-making, multi-specialist consensus, and democratic oversight for AI systems. It provides tamper-proof audit trails, real-time health monitoring, and sophisticated trust management.

## Architecture Overview

Grace implements a comprehensive governance architecture with the following components:

### Core Governance Layer (`layer_01_governance/`)
- **Verification Engine** - Truth validation and claim analysis with constitutional reasoning
- **Unified Logic** - Cross-layer synthesis and arbitration of specialist inputs
- **Governance Engine** - Main orchestrator with policy enforcement and event management
- **Parliament** - Democratic review system for major decisions
- **Trust Core Kernel** - Trust and credibility weighting for sources and components

### Event Infrastructure (`layer_02_event_mesh/`)
- **Trigger Mesh** - Sub-millisecond event routing with priority queues and constitutional validators

### Audit System (`layer_04_audit_logs/`)
- **Immutable Logs** - Blockchain-like tamper-proof audit trail with transparency controls

### Health Monitoring (`immune/`)
- **Enhanced AVN Core** - Anomaly detection, predictive alerts, and automated healing

### ML/DL Consensus (`mldl/`)
- **21-Specialist Quorum** - Expert consensus system with weighted voting
- **Governance Liaison** - Ensures ML/DL model compliance with constitutional principles

### Core Infrastructure (`core/`)
- **Event Bus** - Central event routing and correlation tracking
- **Memory Core** - Persistent storage with precedent-based reasoning
- **Contracts** - Shared data structures and type definitions

## Key Features

### üèõÔ∏è Constitutional Governance
- Enforces transparency, fairness, accountability, consistency, and harm prevention
- Democratic parliamentary review for high-impact decisions
- Precedent-based case reasoning

### ü§ñ 21-Specialist AI Consensus
- Tabular classification/regression, NLP, computer vision, time series
- Reinforcement learning, Bayesian modeling, causal inference
- Fairness auditing, privacy/security scanning, AutoML planning
- Meta-ensembling with governance liaison oversight

### üîí Immutable Audit Trail
- Blockchain-inspired chain verification
- Configurable transparency levels (public ‚Üí security-sensitive)
- Constitutional compliance logging for all decisions

### üìä Real-time Health Monitoring
- Anomaly detection with predictive failure alerts
- Component performance tracking and trust scoring
- Automated healing and failover capabilities

### üîÑ Blue/Green Governance
- Shadow mode testing of governance instances
- Snapshot/rollback capabilities with state verification
- Hot-swap governance with delta comparison

## Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aaron031291/Grace-.git
cd Grace-
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Optional system monitoring dependencies
```

### Basic Usage
```python
import asyncio
from grace_governance_kernel import GraceGovernanceKernel

async def main():
    # Initialize and start governance kernel
    kernel = GraceGovernanceKernel()
    await kernel.start()
    
    # Process a governance request
    result = await kernel.process_governance_request(
        "policy",  # decision type
        {
            "claims": [...],     # Claims to validate
            "context": {...}     # Decision context
        }
    )
    
    print(f"Decision: {result['outcome']}")
    await kernel.shutdown()

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Run Test Suite
```bash
python test_governance_kernel.py
```

## Configuration

Governance behavior is configurable via `config/governance_config.py`:

```python
GOVERNANCE_THRESHOLDS = {
    "min_confidence": 0.78,
    "min_trust": 0.72,
    "constitutional_compliance_min": 0.85
}
```

- Confidence scoring with evidence quality assessment

### Unified Logic  
- Weighted synthesis of 21 specialist outputs
- Cross-layer conflict arbitration
- Domain-specific expertise weighting
- Threshold-based recommendation generation

### Parliament
- Democratic review with configurable voting thresholds
- Expertise-based reviewer assignment
- Deadline-driven decision processes
- Vote tracking and audit trails

### Trust Core

## Event Types

Grace uses a comprehensive event system:

- `GOVERNANCE_VALIDATION` - Request governance decision
- `GOVERNANCE_APPROVED/REJECTED` - Decision outcomes  
- `GOVERNANCE_NEEDS_REVIEW` - Escalation to parliament
- `GOVERNANCE_SNAPSHOT_CREATED` - State snapshots
- `GOVERNANCE_ROLLBACK` - Rollback operations
- `ANOMALY_DETECTED` - Health alerts
- `TRUST_UPDATED` - Trust score changes
- `MLDL_CONSENSUS_REACHED` - Specialist consensus

## Database Schema

Grace maintains several SQLite databases:

- **grace_governance.db** - Decisions, snapshots, experiences, precedents
- **governance_audit.db** - Immutable audit trail with chain verification

## Transparency Levels

Audit logs support configurable transparency:

1. **Public** - Fully accessible (7-year retention)
2. **Democratic Oversight** - Parliament/oversight access (5-year retention)  
3. **Governance Internal** - Internal operations (1-year retention)
4. **Audit Only** - Audit purposes (7-year retention)
5. **Security Sensitive** - Restricted access (90-day retention)

## Meta-Learning

Grace continuously improves through experience collection:

- **Verification Results** - Claim validation performance
- **Consensus Quality** - Specialist agreement effectiveness  
- **Constitutional Compliance** - Principle adherence tracking
- **Trust Updates** - Entity reliability evolution

## Shadow Mode & Rollback

Grace supports blue/green governance deployment:

1. **Shadow Mode** - Run new governance instance alongside current
2. **Delta Tracking** - Compare decisions between instances
3. **Switchover Criteria** - Accuracy, compliance, and latency gates
4. **Rollback** - Revert to last known good snapshot
