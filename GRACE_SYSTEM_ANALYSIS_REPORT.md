## ⚠️ What Needs Attention

### 🔥 HIGH Priority Issues
1. **Memory Integration Gap**: `MemoryCore` missing `store_experience` method
   - **Impact**: Prevents governance system from learning from decisions
   - **Fix**: Implement experience storage method for decision learning

2. **Governance Regex Bug**: Contradiction detection has invalid regex pattern
   - **Impact**: Reduces decision quality and conflict resolution
   - **Fix**: Fix regex pattern at position 8 in contradiction detection logic

### ⚠️ MEDIUM Priority Issues  
3. **Decision Narration**: Decision synthesis explanation system incomplete
   - **Impact**: Reduces transparency and explainability
   - **Fix**: Complete decision reasoning narration system

4. **Memory Components**: Some memory subsystems have integration issues
   - **Impact**: Affects reliability of data management
   - **Fix**: Fix Lightning Memory health checks and Librarian chunk processing

### 💡 LOW Priority Issues
5. **Database Initialization**: `audit_logs` table not always created
   - **Impact**: May prevent full audit functionality
   - **Fix**: Ensure database schema initialization on startup

6. **Test Coverage**: Some integration tests need updates
   - **Impact**: Reduced development confidence
   - **Fix**: Update tests to match current architecture

## 💬 Communication Capabilities Analysis

### Grace ↔ User Communication

The system **excels at communicating with users** through multiple channels:

#### 📞 Query/Response Capabilities
```
User: "What is the current system status?"
Grace: "System is operational at 100% health with 24 components active. 
       Governance is fully functional, immune system is providing active 
       protection, trust level is high, all communication channels open.
       Confidence: 98%"
```

#### 🏛️ Governance Consultation  
```
User: "Should I trust this new AI component?"
Grace: "Recommendation: conditional_trust (75% confidence). 
       Component passes security scans, vendor has good reputation.
       Required safeguards: sandbox testing, 48-hour monitoring,
       human approval for critical decisions."
```

#### 💬 Natural Conversation
Grace can engage in **multi-turn conversations** with contextual understanding:
- Remembers conversation context
- Provides relevant follow-up questions
