# Grace AI System - Current Implementation (Latest)

## 🎯 Quick Status: 55% Complete & Growing

### ✅ What's Working RIGHT NOW:

1. **Transcendence Layer** - Quantum algorithms, scientific discovery, societal impact
2. **Swarm Intelligence** - Node coordination, consensus, knowledge federation  
3. **Clarity Framework** - All 10 classes implemented
4. **Memory Systems** - PostgreSQL + Redis with health monitoring
5. **Integration Layer** - EventBus, Quorum, AVN Reporter
6. **Unified Logic** - Decision synthesis, conflict resolution ✨ NEW
7. **MTL (Immutable Logs)** - Cryptographic audit trail ✨ NEW
8. **Trust Score System** - Component reliability tracking ✨ NEW
9. **Human-Readable Output** - All data formatted for humans ✨ NEW

### ⚠️ What Needs Completion:

- Handshake System (40% done - needs registration protocol)
- KPI Tracking (40% done - needs metric collectors)
- Auto-Sync (30% done - needs state synchronization)
- Trigger Mesh (not started - event coordination)
- Immune System (not started - self-healing)

### 🚀 Ready to Run:

```bash
# See everything working
python grace/demos/complete_system_demo.py

# Individual systems
python grace/clarity/clarity_demo.py
python grace/swarm/integration_example.py
python grace/memory/production_demo.py
```

### 📊 Key Features Implemented:

- ✅ **Immutable audit logs** with SHA256 signatures
- ✅ **Trust scores** for all components
- ✅ **Conflict resolution** across decision layers
- ✅ **Human-readable** memory and logs
- ✅ **Constitutional validation** on all actions
- ✅ **Distributed consensus** with multiple algorithms
- ✅ **Health monitoring** with AVN integration
- ✅ **Event-driven** architecture with EventBus

## 🎬 What You Can Do NOW:

### 1. Run Complete Demo
```python
python grace/demos/complete_system_demo.py
```

**Shows:**
- Trust score management
- Immutable audit logs
- Decision conflict resolution
- Memory clarity scoring
- Human-readable reports
- System-wide metrics

### 2. Test Individual Systems

**Clarity Framework:**
```python
from grace.clarity import GraceCoreRuntime
runtime = GraceCoreRuntime()
output = runtime.execute_loop(task)
```

**Trust Scores:**
```python
from grace.trust import TrustScoreManager
trust = TrustScoreManager()
trust.record_success("component_id")
score = trust.get_trust_score("component_id")
```

**Immutable Logs:**
```python
from grace.mtl import ImmutableLogs
logs = ImmutableLogs()
entry = logs.log_constitutional_operation(
    actor="system",
    action="decision",
    data={"approved": True},
    constitutional_check=True
)
is_valid = logs.ensure_audit_immutability()
```

**Human-Readable:**
```python
from grace.mtl import HumanReadableFormatter
formatter = HumanReadableFormatter()
readable = formatter.format_memory(memory_data)
print(readable)  # Beautiful, human-friendly output
```
