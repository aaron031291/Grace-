TO RUN AUDIT:
=============

QUICK START (30 seconds):

  python grace/diagnostics/wiring_audit.py

EXPECTED OUTPUT:

  ✅ PASSED: 50+ checks
  ⚠️  WARNINGS: 0-5 items
  ❌ ERRORS: 0 items
  
  STATUS: ✅ ALL SYSTEMS WIRED UP CORRECTLY


DETAILED VERIFICATION:
======================

After successful audit, system is:

✅ Logging: Verified
✅ Metrics: Verified
✅ Security: Verified
✅ Performance: Verified

STATUS: 🚀 PRODUCTION READY


TROUBLESHOOTING:
================

If audit reports errors:

1. Read error message carefully
2. Check component mentioned
3. Verify imports in __init__.py
4. Check method signatures match
5. Review error in context
6. Fix and re-run audit

For help:
  - Review WIRING_VERIFICATION.md
  - Check WIRING_QUICK_REFERENCE.txt
  - Look at WIRING_AUDIT_SUMMARY.md


DOCUMENTATION:
==============

Complete system documentation:
  - ARCHITECTURE.md
  - ARCHITECTURE_VISUAL.txt
  - grace/core/truth_layer.py
  - grace/memory/unified_memory_system.py
  - grace/orchestration/trigger_mesh.py
  - grace/kernels/ (all kernel files)
  - grace/services/ (all service files)


NEXT STEPS:
===========

1. Run audit:
   python grace/diagnostics/wiring_audit.py

2. Review results (should pass all checks)

3. If passes:
   - System is ready
   - Deploy with confidence
   - Monitor in production

4. If fails:
   - Review errors
   - Fix issues
   - Re-run audit


VERIFICATION TIMELINE:
