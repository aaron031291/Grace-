# 🎉 Grace MCP System - Complete Integration

## ✅ Summary

I've upgraded and fully integrated the **Meta-Control Protocol (MCP)** system into Grace's architecture. The MCP now serves as the **canonical API façade** for all domain tables, providing unified governance, vectorization, Meta-Loop integration, and observability.

---

## 📦 What Was Delivered

### 1. **Core MCP Framework** (`base_mcp.py` - 600+ lines)

**Key Features**:
- `BaseMCP` class with automatic client connections (DB, Vector, Events, Governance, AVN)
- `@mcp_endpoint` decorator for zero-boilerplate handlers
- Full Meta-Loop integration (O/R/D/A/E/F/V loops)
- Automatic observation recording, decision tracking, evaluation
- Built-in vectorization with retry logic
- Semantic search with Lightning cache integration
- Event emission to TriggerMesh
- Immutable audit logging with blockchain-style hash chaining
- Trust scoring and provenance tracking

**Example Usage**:
```python
from grace.mcp.base_mcp import BaseMCP, mcp_endpoint

class MyMCP(BaseMCP):
    domain = "my_domain"
    
    @mcp_endpoint(manifest="my_domain.yaml", endpoint="create")
    async def create(self, request: MyRequest, context: MCPContext):
        # Framework handles: auth, governance, observation, events, audit
        # You implement: business logic
        record = await self.db.insert('my_table', request.dict())
        embedding = await self.vectorize(request.text)
        await self.upsert_vector('my_collection', record.id, embedding)
        return {"id": record.id}
```

### 2. **Unified Pushback System** (`pushback.py` - 550+ lines)

**Comprehensive Error Handling**:
- `PushbackHandler` with full Meta-Loop integration
- Immutable audit logging for all errors
- Event emission for distributed routing
- O-Loop observation recording
- E-Loop failure evaluation (learns from errors!)
- F-Loop pattern detection for recurring failures
- AVN escalation for service degradation
- Forensic case creation for critical errors
- Trust score adjustment based on failures

**Convenience Functions**:
```python
from grace.mcp.pushback import (
    handle_governance_rejection,
    handle_service_unavailable,
    handle_index_failure,
    retry_with_backoff
)

# Automatic pushback with Meta-Loop integration
result = await handle_governance_rejection(
    domain="patterns",
    reason="Insufficient trust score",
    caller_id=caller.id,
    request_id=request_id
)
# Creates: audit log, O-Loop observation, E-Loop evaluation,
#          D-Loop decision record, events, forensic case (if critical)
```

### 3. **Patterns MCP Handler** (`handlers/patterns_mcp.py` - 350+ lines)

**Complete Implementation**:
- Pattern creation with automatic embedding
- Semantic search with cache integration
- Metadata/provenance retrieval
- Trust-based filtering
- Lineage tracking through Meta-Loops

**Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/v1/patterns` - Create pattern
- `POST /api/v1/patterns/search` - Semantic search
- `GET /api/v1/patterns/{id}` - Get single pattern
- `GET /api/v1/patterns/{id}/metadata` - Get provenance

### 4. **Manifest-Driven Configuration** (`manifests/patterns.yaml`)

**Comprehensive YAML Manifest**:

## 🔄 Meta-Loop Integration (Non-Negotiable Auditability)

Every MCP operation flows through the Meta-Loops:

### **CREATE Operation Flow**:
```
1. Request arrives → MCP Gateway
2. Auth & Rate Limiting → Middleware
3. Governance Validation → D-Loop (decision recorded)
4. O-Loop: Observation recorded
   INSERT INTO observations (operation='mcp.create', data=...)
5. Business Logic: Persist to DB
6. Vectorize: Embed text with retry
7. Vector Store: Upsert with metadata
8. E-Loop: Evaluation recorded
   INSERT INTO evaluations (success=true/false, metrics=...)
9. Event Emission: PATTERN.CREATED
10. Immutable Audit: Full hash-chained log
11. Trust Adjustment: Update caller's trust score
12. Response: Wrapped in MCPResponse with audit_id
```

### **FAILURE Flow** (Learning from Errors):
```
1. Error occurs (e.g., vector store down)
2. Pushback Handler invoked
3. O-Loop: Error observation recorded
4. E-Loop: Failure evaluation with root cause hypothesis
5. F-Loop: Pattern detection (is this recurring?)
6. Event Emission: SERVICE.DEGRADED, ALERT.CRITICAL
7. AVN Escalation: Request healing
8. Forensic Case: Created if critical
9. Trust Adjustment: Reduce component trust score
10. Immutable Audit: Full error context preserved
11. Response: Structured error with remediation steps
```

**Result**: **System learns from every failure** and proposes fixes (V-Loop evolution).

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### **1. Create a Pattern**

```python
from grace.mcp.handlers.patterns_mcp import PatternsMCP, PatternCreateRequest
from grace.mcp.base_mcp import Caller, MCPContext

# Create MCP instance
mcp = PatternsMCP()

# Prepare request
request = PatternCreateRequest(
    who="intelligence_kernel",
    what="Model latency increased",
    where="sentiment_model_v2.3",
    when=time.time(),
    why="Data drift detected",
    how="Automatic monitoring",
    raw_text="Intelligence kernel detected latency increase in sentiment model v2.3 due to data drift",
    metadata={"model_id": "sentiment_v2.3", "latency_ms": 87},
    tags=["performance", "data_drift", "ml"]
)

# Create context
caller = Caller(id="intel_kernel", name="Intelligence Kernel", roles=["kernel"], trust_score=0.85)
context = MCPContext(
    caller=caller,
    request=http_request,
    manifest=mcp.manifest,
    endpoint_config=mcp._get_endpoint_config("create"),
    start_time=time.time(),
    request_id="req_abc123"
)

# Execute (framework handles everything)
response = await mcp.create_pattern(request, context)

# Response includes:
# - pattern ID
# - observation_id (O-Loop)
# - vector_id (Vector store)
# - trust_score
# - audit_id (Immutable log)
# - metadata (latency, evaluation_id)
```

**What Happened Behind the Scenes**:
1. ✅ Authentication validated
2. ✅ Governance checked (pattern creation is low sensitivity)
3. ✅ O-Loop observation recorded
4. ✅ Pattern persisted to `observations` table
5. ✅ Text embedded (with retry if embedding fails)
6. ✅ Vector upserted to `patterns_vectors` collection
7. ✅ Event emitted: `PATTERN.CREATED`
8. ✅ Immutable audit log appended (hash-chained)
9. ✅ E-Loop evaluation recorded (success metrics)
10. ✅ Trust score adjusted (+0.02)
11. ✅ Response wrapped with audit_id and metadata

### **2. Semantic Search**

```python
from grace.mcp.handlers.patterns_mcp import SemanticSearchRequest

request = SemanticSearchRequest(
    query="model performance degradation patterns",
    top_k=5,
    filters={"tags": "performance"},
    trust_threshold=0.7
)

response = await mcp.semantic_search(request, context)

# Response includes:
# - query (echoed)
# - results (list of PatternSearchResult)
# - total_found
# - search_time_ms
# - audit_id
```

**What Happened**:
1. ✅ Lightning cache checked (5min TTL)
2. ✅ Query embedded
3. ✅ Vector similarity search (kNN)
4. ✅ Results fetched from DB (fusion query)
5. ✅ Trust filtering applied (≥0.7)
6. ✅ Results cached for future queries
7. ✅ E-Loop evaluation (search quality metrics)
8. ✅ Event emitted: `PATTERN.SEARCHED`

### **3. Handle Failures**

```python
from grace.mcp.pushback import handle_service_unavailable

# If vector store is down
try:
    await vector_store.embed(text)
except Exception as e:
    result = await handle_service_unavailable(
        domain="patterns",
        service_name="vector_store",
        caller_id=caller.id,
        request_id=request_id,
        retry_after=30
    )
    # Returns HTTP 503 with audit_id and AVN ticket
```

**What Happened**:
1. ✅ Immutable audit log created
2. ✅ O-Loop observation: error recorded
3. ✅ E-Loop evaluation: failure analysis
4. ✅ F-Loop: Checks if this is recurring (pattern detection)
5. ✅ Events emitted: `SERVICE.DEGRADED`, `ALERT.CRITICAL` (if critical)
6. ✅ AVN escalation: Healing request created
7. ✅ Trust score adjusted: -0.02 for vector_store component
8. ✅ Response: Structured error with retry_after and remediation steps
