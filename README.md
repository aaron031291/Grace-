## Quick Start

### Automated Setup (Recommended)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aaron031291/Grace-.git
cd Grace-
./scripts/setup.sh
```

The setup script will automatically:
- Install Python and Git if needed (Linux/macOS)
- Create a virtual environment
- Install all dependencies
- Configure Git settings
- Set up development tools

### Manual Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aaron031291/Grace-.git
cd Grace-
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.template .env  # Edit with your configuration
```

### Basic Usage
```python
import asyncio
from grace.governance.grace_governance_kernel import GraceGovernanceKernel

async def main():
    # Initialize and start governance kernel
    kernel = GraceGovernanceKernel()
    await kernel.start()
    
    )
    

```

### Governance Enforcement Hooks
```python
from grace.governance.constitutional_decorator import trust_middleware, constitutional_check

@constitutional_check
@trust_middleware(min_trust_score=0.8)
async def high_trust_operation(data):
    # Operation requiring high trust score and constitutional compliance
    return data
```
# In your API endpoints or operations:
audit_id = await append_audit(
    operation_data={"action": "data_ingestion"},
    user_id="user123",
)
```

### Test Quality Monitoring
Grace includes an automated test quality monitoring system that ensures system reliability:

```python
# Pytest automatically tracks quality via the pytest plugin
# Run tests to generate quality reports
pytest

# Quality reports are saved to test_reports/ with component-level metrics:
# - Raw score (pass rate)
# - Trust-adjusted score (blends current + historical performance)
# - Quality status (EXCELLENT ‚â•95%, PASSING ‚â•90%, ACCEPTABLE ‚â•70%, etc.)
# - Self-healing trigger status
```

**Current System Quality (as of October 14, 2025):**
- **System Pass Rate**: 100% ‚úÖ
- **Overall Quality**: 95.3% (EXCELLENT)
- **Components Passing**: 6/6 (100%)
  - contract_compliance: 95.4% (EXCELLENT)
  - tracing_system: 97.2% (EXCELLENT)
  - general_tests: 100.0% (EXCELLENT)
  - comprehensive_e2e: 93.6% (PASSING)
  - intelligence_kernel: 91.0% (PASSING)
  - mcp_framework: 94.5% (PASSING)

**Self-Healing Events Published:**
- `test_quality.component_status_changed` - Status transitions (DEGRADED ‚Üí PASSING, etc.)
- `test_quality.healing_required` - Quality drops below 70% (routes to AVN kernel)
- `test_quality.improvement_suggested` - Quality below 90% (routes to learning kernel)

#### Policy Enforcement Middleware
- Validates operations against policy rules
- Blocks unauthorized actions

## Development Workflow

```bash
# Linux/macOS

.\scripts\git-workflow.ps1 <command>
```
- `setup` - Configure Git settings
- `new-branch feature/my-feature` - Create new feature branch

> 
> - **Governance Kernel** - Constitutional decision-making
> - **Intelligence Kernel** - AI reasoning and validation  
> - **Learning Kernel** - Adaptive learning and improvement
> - **Memory Kernel** - Persistent storage and retrieval
> - **Trust Kernel** - Credibility and reliability management
> - **Interface Kernel** - User and system interfaces
> - **Orchestration Kernel** - Workflow coordination
> - **Resilience Kernel** - Health monitoring and recovery
> - **Ingress Kernel** - Data input and validation
> - **Multi-OS Kernel** - Cross-platform compatibility
> - **MLdL Kernel** - Machine learning specialists
