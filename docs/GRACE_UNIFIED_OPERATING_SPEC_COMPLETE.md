# Grace Unified Operating Specification

(North-Star Architecture + Memory Integration + Complete System Hardening)

---

## 1. Purpose
Grace must function as a self-healing, self-learning, transparent co-partner, where humans and the AI share insight, context, and control through the Orb interface. Everything — from memory items to immutable logs, from voice commands to sandbox executions — connects through a single, governed event fabric.

---

## 2. North-Star Principles
1. Transparency: every metric, log, and memory is inspectable and explainable.
2. Co-ownership: Grace and humans share authority; either can propose, test, or approve.
3. Progressive disclosure: surface simplicity; reveal depth on demand.
4. Safety by default: every change has preview → simulation → apply → undo.
5. Learning loop: each interaction updates trust, confidence, and context across the system.
6. Multimodal access: voice, text, UI, or API — identical semantics.

## 4. Interaction Lifecycle
1. Intent → user says “optimize API latency.”
2. Parsing → Grace builds structured plan + KPIs.
3. Context linking → relevant Memory folders auto-attached.
4. Simulation → AVN proposes 3 fixes, runs sandbox proof.
5. Presentation → Orb displays results, rationale, trust deltas.
6. Decision → human approves / Grace auto-promotes (per policy).
7. Execution → changes applied, metrics tracked, log written.
8. Learning → memory + trust updated, meta-loop tick logged.

## 5. Core Components

### 5.1 Loop Orchestrator
- Async scheduler (grace/loop_orchestrator.py): coordinates ticks for AVN, Memory, Governance, and Metrics.
- Context bus (Redis/event-mesh): grace.context.current ensures all components share unified “now.”
- Health pulse endpoint /health/full aggregates component trust.

### 5.2 Global Identity Mesh
- Short-lived JWT/OAuth tokens per user/service.
- Delegation scopes (“sandbox only”, “approve governance”).
- Chain-of-trust verified via signatures in immutable ledger.

### 5.3 Governance Layer
- Policies as code (policy/*.yml).
- Quorum approvals before risky operations.
- Immutable decision threads accessible via /governance/audit/{id}.

### 5.4 Memory Explorer
- File-Explorer interface for Grace’s cognition.
- Folder Context Manifests define purpose, domain, and policies.
- Auto-classification + embedding pipeline on file drop.
- Integration with RCA, Playbooks, and AVN suggestions.
- Trust feedback from success/failure loops.
- CAS + Postgres + Qdrant storage with adjacency graph.
- Search, link, promote, and contextual explainers via /memory/* APIs.

### 5.5 AVN / RCA / Healing Engine
- Detects anomalies from metrics.
- Uses Memory Explorer to fetch related patterns & fixes.
- Runs sandbox proofs, evaluates KPIs, logs immutable result.
- Self-heals both target and its own pipeline.

### 5.6 Observability Fabric
- Unified trace IDs across every layer.
- Prometheus + OpenTelemetry exporters.
- Orb dashboards for KPI, trust, and governance metrics.
- Event analytics: MTTR, decision latency, learning gains.

### 5.7 Orb Interface (UX)
- Command Palette: natural language → plan preview.
- Hover Cards: inline explanations, top 3 fixes.
- Repair Drawer: tabs for Plan, Diff, Tests, Policies, Impact, History, Memory Used.
- Timeline: full chronological event view.
- Voice mode: speak commands and hear narrated feedback.
- Accessibility: full keyboard flow, high contrast, minimal motion.
- Multimodal: identical semantics for voice, text, UI, API.
- Real-time collaboration: multi-user session, approvals, chat overlay.
- Silent autonomous mode: Grace acts automatically within delegated scope.

## 6. Extended Layers

### 6.1 Knowledge & Model Lifecycle
- Model Registry: track embedding and reasoning model versions.
- Retraining hooks from successful repairs.
- Knowledge decay: confidence ↓ for unused or stale memory items.

### 6.2 Runtime Safety
- Sandbox quota + resource isolation.
- Dead-man switch halts promotions if governance offline.
- Anomaly replay harness for regression testing of learning.

### 6.3 Backup & Federation
- Periodic Vault snapshots of Memory (CAS + vectors + manifest).
- Federated sync between Grace nodes using gossip protocol and hash reconciliation.
- Region-based sovereignty enforcement.

### 6.4 Economic & Resource Awareness
- Cost telemetry: compute/time cost per loop.
- Energy metrics: integrates with PowerWell or solar telemetry.

### 6.5 Developer & CI/CD Hooks
- GitHub Actions pipeline running tests, SAST, policy scans.
- Schema registry + DB migrations versioned and logged.
- Mock environment toggle for demos/training.

## 8. Voice & Collaboration

| Mode           | Description                                                        |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Solo Voice     | Grace listens, executes, narrates.                                 |
| Text-Only      | Identical semantics; command palette + keyboard shortcuts.          |
| Co-Partner     | Multi-user collaborative session; real-time approvals and chat.     |
| Silent Auto    | Grace acts automatically within delegated scope.                    |

All commands emit immutable intent.command.v1 logs.

---

## 9. Trust & KPI Framework

| Metric            | Description                        | Logged As                |
|-------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| trust_component   | reliability of each subsystem      | trust.status.v1          |
| trust_memory      | reliability of specific folder/item | annotation on memory.item.used |
| kpi_perf          | system performance KPIs            | metrics.snapshot.v1      |
| governance_latency| time between proposal and approval | gov.latency.v1           |
| learning_gain     | improvement in future decision conf | meta.loop.tick.v1        |

Trust drift bounded ±0.05 over 30-day rolling window.

---

## 10. Observability & Explainability
- Every event has trace_id.
- Orb “Ask Why / What If” overlays: causal graph + counterfactual simulation.
- Three explanation levels (Beginner / Advanced / SRE).
- Unified visual vocabulary (Proposed → Proving → Governed → Promoted → Rolled Back).
- Storybook exporter: incident → resolution → KPI delta → who approved.

---

## 11. Security & Mutability
1. Append-only logs with SHA-256 hash-chains.
2. Annotations correct, never overwrite.
3. Governance signatures required for schema/policy edits.
4. Memory item versions by content hash; edits create new linked version.
5. RBAC per namespace; region-bound data access.
6. Secrets redacted at ingestion.
7. Rollback via stored diff and snapshot.

---

## 12. Multimodal / Multi-OS Layer
- Unified Runner API for Linux, Windows, macOS:

    Runner.execute(patch)
    Runner.restart(service)
    Runner.metrics()
    Runner.rollback(artifact)

- OS adapters translate to native commands (systemd, PowerShell, launchd).
- Metrics normalized (cpu_load, mem_pressure, api_p95_ms).

---

## 13. Success Metrics (Operational KPIs)

| Category      | KPI                        | Target         |
|---------------|----------------------------|---------------|
| Comprehension | Mean Time to Understand    | < 10 s        |
| Healing       | Mean Time to Repair        | < 5 min       |
| Governance    | Approval latency           | < 60 s        |
| Memory        | Retrieval precision (top-3)| ≥ 90 %        |
| Voice         | Intent accuracy            | ≥ 95 %        |
| Trust         | Drift stability            | ± 0.05 / 30d  |
| Accessibility | UI compliance              | ≥ 95 axe-score|

## 14. Implementation Phasing

Phase 1: Core Orchestrator + Immutable Log + Memory API + Orb skeleton
Phase 2: Governance, Trust Engine, Voice/Palette control
Phase 3: Observability Fabric + Sandbox Safety Nets + Multi-OS runners
Phase 4: Federation, Cost/Energy telemetry, Developer CI hooks
Phase 5: Full co-partner autonomy & meta-learning feedback loops

---

## 15. The End-State
When all layers operate in concert:
- The Orb becomes Grace’s unified cockpit.
- Memory Explorer is the brain’s cortex — every insight stored and traceable.
- Immutable Logs form the spine — every nerve impulse recorded and auditable.
- Governance acts as conscience.
- Trust Metrics and KPIs are the bloodstream.
- Voice & Collaboration make her conversational, transparent, and co-creative.

Grace is then a truly self-documenting, self-healing, self-improving intelligence — able to reason, explain, adapt, and build safely with her human partners in full view.
