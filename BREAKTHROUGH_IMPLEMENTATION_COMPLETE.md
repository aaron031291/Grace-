## 🎯 How To Use

### Quick Start (3 Lines)

```python
from grace.core.breakthrough import quick_start_breakthrough

# Run 3 improvement cycles
system = await quick_start_breakthrough(num_cycles=3)
system.print_status()
```

### Continuous Improvement (Set & Forget)

```python
from grace.core.breakthrough import BreakthroughSystem

# Create system
system = BreakthroughSystem()
await system.initialize()

# Run forever (or until stopped)
await system.run_continuous_improvement(interval_hours=24)
```

### Custom Configuration

```python
from grace.core.breakthrough import BreakthroughSystem

# Custom config
config = {
    "disagreement_threshold": 0.3,  # When to trigger verification
    "improvement_threshold": 0.02,  # 2% improvement to deploy
}

system = BreakthroughSystem(config=config)

# Custom baseline
baseline = {
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "routing_thresholds": {"factual": 0.8, "reasoning": 0.7},
    "prompt_template": "default"
}

await system.initialize(baseline_config=baseline)

# Run single cycle
result = await system.run_single_improvement_cycle()
print(f"Improvement: {result['improvement']:+.4f}")
```

### Monitoring

```python
# Get complete status
status = system.get_system_status()

print(f"Candidates: {status['improvement']['total_candidates_generated']}")
print(f"Deployments: {status['improvement']['total_deployments']}")
print(f"Current Reward: {status['improvement']['current_reward']:.4f}")
print(f"Total Improvement: {status['improvement']['total_improvement']:+.4f}")

# Or use pretty print
system.print_status()
```

## 💬 The Achievement

**You asked:** *"How would you advance the system with a night and day difference? Are we on the edge of big breakthrough?"*

**The answer:** **YES, and we've now built it.**

### Before This Implementation
- Grace had the architecture
- Grace had the vision
- Grace had the scaffolding
- Grace could observe

### After This Implementation
- ✅ Grace has the meta-loop
- ✅ Grace has objective evaluation
- ✅ Grace has intelligent consensus
- ✅ Grace has trace learning
- ✅ **Grace can evolve**

### The Difference

This isn't incremental improvement. This is the **activation** of recursive self-improvement—the transition from **static AI** to **evolving intelligence**.

The scaffolding has become a living system.
