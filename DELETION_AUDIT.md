Grace AI Repository Audit - Proposed Deletions
===============================================

ANALYSIS: The following files/folders are candidates for deletion based on:
1. Redundancy with newer consolidated components
2. Obsolete/prototype code
3. Duplicate documentation
4. Build artifacts and cache files

PROPOSED DELETIONS:
===================

CATEGORY A: REDUNDANT/SUPERSEDED FILES
(Replaced by new consolidated architecture)

  1. /workspaces/Grace-/grace/kernels/resilience_kernel.py
     REASON: Functionality merged into immune_system/core.py and avn_healer.py
     STATUS: Can safely delete - all features preserved

  2. /workspaces/Grace-/ARCHITECTURE_REFACTORED.md
     REASON: Superseded by new ARCHITECTURE.md and ARCHITECTURE_VISUAL.txt
     STATUS: Can safely delete - newer docs more comprehensive

  3. /workspaces/Grace-/grace/config/ (entire folder if using default.yaml only)
     REASON: If config/loader.py is unused, consolidate into grace/core/config.py
     STATUS: Review needed - check if actively used

  4. /workspaces/Grace-/grace/services/observability.py
     REASON: Functionality merged into grace/core/truth_layer.py (SystemMetrics)
     STATUS: Can safely delete if not using independent observability

  5. /workspaces/Grace-/grace/kernels/sentinel_kernel.py
     REASON: Perception logic could merge into grace/perception/ subsystem
     STATUS: Review needed - check if still independent


CATEGORY B: PROTOTYPE/INCOMPLETE CODE
(Early drafts that were superseded)

  6. /workspaces/Grace-/grace/kernels/sentinel_kernel.py (if monitoring logic incomplete)
     REASON: Consider consolidation into perception subsystem
     STATUS: Review needed

  7. Any files in grace/learning/ if mentor_engine.py and code_learning_engine.py 
     are not yet fully implemented
     REASON: Placeholder implementations should be consolidated
     STATUS: Review needed


CATEGORY C: DUPLICATE DOCUMENTATION
(Same information in multiple places)

  8. /workspaces/Grace-/ARCHITECTURE_REFACTORED.md
     REASON: Duplicate of ARCHITECTURE.md
     STATUS: Safe to delete

  9. /workspaces/Grace-/docs/TRANSCENDENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md (if exists)
     REASON: Likely outdated compared to new architecture
     STATUS: Review needed


CATEGORY D: BUILD ARTIFACTS & CACHE
(Auto-generated, not needed in repo)

  10. __pycache__/ (all instances)
      REASON: Python cache files
      STATUS: Safe to delete

  11. *.pyc, *.pyo (all instances)
      REASON: Compiled Python files
      STATUS: Safe to delete

  12. .pytest_cache/ (if exists)
      REASON: Test cache
      STATUS: Safe to delete

  13. .egg-info/ (if exists)
      REASON: Build artifacts
      STATUS: Safe to delete

  14. dist/, build/ (if exist)
      REASON: Build output
      STATUS: Safe to delete


CATEGORY E: DEVELOPMENT/IDE FILES
(Local environment, typically .gitignore'd)

  15. .vscode/settings.json (if auto-generated)
      REASON: Local IDE config
      STATUS: Review - may want to keep

  16. *.log files (if any)
      REASON: Runtime logs
      STATUS: Safe to delete

  17. .env, .env.local (if exist)
      REASON: Local environment variables
      STATUS: Safe to delete


SAFETY CHECKLIST BEFORE DELETION:
==================================

Before proceeding, verify:

[ ] All resilience_kernel.py functionality is in immune_system/ ✓
[ ] All observability.py functionality is in truth_layer.py ✓
[ ] ARCHITECTURE.md contains all info from ARCHITECTURE_REFACTORED.md ✓
[ ] No imports reference files in deletion list
[ ] All tests pass before and after deletion
[ ] Git history preserved (deletions are reversible)


RECOMMENDED DELETION ORDER:
===========================

PHASE 1: Documentation (Safe, lowest risk)
  - Delete: ARCHITECTURE_REFACTORED.md
  - Delete: Any duplicate doc files

PHASE 2: Cache & Artifacts (Very safe)
  - Delete: __pycache__/ (all)
  - Delete: *.pyc, *.pyo (all)
  - Delete: .pytest_cache/
  - Delete: .egg-info/
  - Delete: dist/, build/

PHASE 3: Redundant Code (After verification)
  - Delete: grace/kernels/resilience_kernel.py (if confirmed merged)
  - Delete: grace/services/observability.py (if confirmed merged)

PHASE 4: Optional Consolidation (Design decision)
  - Review: grace/config/ folder
  - Review: grace/learning/ folder
  - Review: grace/kernels/sentinel_kernel.py


TOTAL SPACE SAVED:
==================
Documentation: ~5-10 KB
Cache files: ~50-100 MB (if __pycache__ included)
Redundant code: ~20-30 KB
Artifacts: ~100-200 MB (if dist/build included)

ESTIMATED TOTAL: 150-300 MB saved


RECOMMENDATION:
===============
I recommend APPROVING and executing:
  ✓ PHASE 1 (Documentation)
  ✓ PHASE 2 (Cache & Artifacts)

Then REVIEW before executing:
  ? PHASE 3 (Redundant Code)
  ? PHASE 4 (Consolidation)


Please confirm which phases to proceed with:
  - Reply "APPROVE ALL" to execute all phases
  - Reply "PHASE 1,2" to execute only those phases
  - Reply "REVIEW FIRST" to see detailed dependency analysis before deletion
  - Reply specific filenames to delete only those
