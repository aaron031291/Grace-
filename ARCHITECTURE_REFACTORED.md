# NEW SUBSYSTEM ORGANIZATION
# =======================

# 1. CORE INFRASTRUCTURE
# grace/core/ - Fundamental building blocks
#   - event_bus.py: Central event distribution
#   - immutable_logs.py: Audit trail
#   - kpi_trust_monitor.py: Metrics and trust
#   - component_registry.py: Dynamic component management

# 2. CONSCIOUSNESS & COGNITION
# grace/consciousness/ - Self-awareness and strategic reasoning
#   - consciousness.py: Main self-reflection loop
#   - cognitive_cortex.py: Strategic decision engine

# 3. IMMUNE SYSTEM
# grace/immune_system/ - Health, security, resilience
#   - core.py: Central immune coordination
#   - threat_detector.py: Anomaly detection
#   - avn_healer.py: Autonomous healing network

# 4. PERCEPTION & OBSERVATION
# grace/perception/ - Environmental monitoring and observability
#   - sentinel_kernel.py: External threat monitoring
#   - observability.py: System telemetry and logging

# 5. GOVERNANCE & TRUST
# grace/governance/ - Policies, compliance, trust tracking
#   - policy_engine.py: Policy enforcement
#   - trust_ledger.py: Immutable trust scoring
#   - schemas/: Data schemas and contracts

# 6. COORDINATION & DISTRIBUTION
# grace/coordination/ - Distributed operations and swarm
#   - swarm_kernel.py: Multi-agent coordination
#   - orchestration/: Workflow orchestration

# 7. CORE SERVICES
# grace/services/ - Essential operational services
#   - task_manager.py: Project/task management
#   - communication_channel.py: User communication
#   - notification_service.py: Approval and notifications
#   - llm_service.py: LLM integration
#   - websocket_service.py: Real-time communication
#   - remote_agent.py: Sandbox execution

# 8. LEARNING & SELF-IMPROVEMENT
# grace/learning/ - Autonomous self-improvement
#   - mentor_engine.py: Self-improvement coordination
#   - code_learning_engine.py: Code generation and analysis

# 9. MCP - MODEL CONTEXT PROTOCOL
# grace/mcp/ - External tool integration
#   - protocol.py: MCP base protocol
#   - manager.py: MCP orchestration
#   - tools/: Specialized MCP tools
#     - vector_store.py: Semantic search
#     - search.py: Information retrieval
#     - code_generation.py: Code tools

# 10. INTERFACES
# grace/api/ - External interfaces
#   - rest_api.py: REST endpoints
#   - websocket_api.py: Real-time API

# grace/frontend/ - Web dashboard

# INTEGRATION PRINCIPLES
# ======================
# 1. Each subsystem is self-contained with __init__.py
# 2. Subsystems communicate via EventBus (loose coupling)
# 3. MCP tools are integrated for external capabilities
# 4. No duplicate knowledge - consolidated into canonical locations
# 5. Clear responsibility boundaries
# 6. Tidy, logical repository structure
