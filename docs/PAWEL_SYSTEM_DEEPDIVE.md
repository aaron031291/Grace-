# Grace System Deep Dive — How Everything Ticks, Talks, Connects, Learns, Evolves, and Grows

## Purpose
This document provides a finite, end-to-end explanation of the Grace system for Pawel. After reading, you will understand every major component, how they interact, how learning and evolution occur, and why each part exists.

---

## 1. System Heartbeat: The Orchestrator
- **Loop Orchestrator** is the scheduler and context bus. It coordinates ticks for anomaly detection (AVN), memory updates, governance checks, and metrics collection.
- Every tick is a system-wide pulse: events are published, state is updated, and learning loops are triggered.

---

## 2. Event Fabric: How Everything Talks
- **Event Bus** connects all modules (API, workers, memory, governance, observability).
- Events are standardized envelopes with trace IDs, actor, payload, KPIs, trust deltas, and immutable hashes.
- Every action (user, AI, system) emits an event, logged immutably and propagated to relevant listeners.

---

## 3. Memory Explorer: The Cognitive Backbone
- **Memory Explorer** is a file-explorer-like interface for Grace’s cognition.
- All knowledge, playbooks, patterns, and context are stored as memory items, each with trust scores, vector embeddings, and policy references.
- Memory is updated on every successful or failed action, with trust and confidence recalibrated.

---

## 4. AVN / RCA / Healing: How Grace Learns and Repairs
- **AVN (Autonomous Validation Network)** detects anomalies using SLOs, metrics, and traces.
- **RCA (Root Cause Analysis)** correlates metrics, logs, and traces to hypothesize causes and propose fixes.
- **AutoPatch** generates patch options, which are validated by consensus (L1: file, L2: subsystem, L3: execution).
- **Sandbox** runs ephemeral tests, simulates fixes, and validates impact before promotion.
- **Governance** enforces policy, requires quorum approval, and logs every decision.
- **Meta-learning loop**: Every remediation event updates skill weights, trust scores, and knowledge embeddings.

---

## 5. Observability & Metrics: How Grace Sees Itself
- **Prometheus & OpenTelemetry** collect metrics and traces from every layer (API, worker, DB, memory, governance).
- SLOs and alert rules trigger auto-rollback and self-healing when breached.
- Dashboards visualize health, trust, KPIs, and governance latency.

---

## 6. Security & Governance: Why Everything Is Safe
- **Immutable logs**: Every event, decision, and change is hash-chained and auditable.
- **RBAC & region-bound access**: Only authorized actors can perform sensitive actions.
- **Policy enforcement**: Data sovereignty, blast-radius, and secrets redaction are mandatory.
- **Rollback**: All changes are reversible via signed, pre-staged artifacts.

---

## 7. Multimodal & Multi-OS: How Grace Adapts
- **Orb UI**: Voice, text, hover, and API all share identical semantics.
- **Runner API**: Linux, Windows, macOS adapters translate actions to native commands (systemd, PowerShell, launchd).
- Metrics are normalized across OSes; all actions are logged and signed.

---

## 8. Learning & Evolution: How Grace Grows
- **Meta-learning**: Every fix, rollback, and success/failure updates skill weights and knowledge embeddings.
- **Knowledge base**: Ingested playbooks, patterns, and references are chunked, embedded, and retrievable for RCA and repair.
- **Trust drift**: Trust scores evolve with usage, success, and human feedback.
- **Federation**: Grace nodes sync state via gossip protocol, enabling distributed learning and resilience.

## 9. End-to-End Flow: What Happens When...
1. User (or Grace) initiates an action (e.g., "optimize API latency").
2. Intent is parsed, plan is generated, and context is linked to relevant memory.
3. AVN detects anomaly, RCA hypothesizes cause, AutoPatch proposes fixes.
4. Consensus modules validate, sandbox simulates, governance approves.
5. Change is applied, metrics and trust are updated, event is logged.
6. Meta-learning loop updates skills and knowledge, memory explorer reflects new state.
7. If SLO is breached, auto-rollback is triggered, and the system self-heals.

---

## 10. Why: The Philosophy
- Grace is designed for transparency, co-ownership, safety, and continuous improvement.
- Every part exists to ensure the system is auditable, explainable, and resilient.
- Human and AI collaborate, learn, and govern together, with every action traceable and reversible.

---

## 11. Where & When: System Boundaries
- All actions, decisions, and learning are timestamped, logged, and versioned.
- Backups, snapshots, and federation ensure no single point of failure.
- Runbooks and setup guides ensure anyone can operate, recover, and extend the system.

---

## 12. How: Technical Details
- See `GRACE_UNIFIED_OPERATING_SPEC_COMPLETE.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, and all runbooks for implementation specifics.
- Every module is documented, every flow is diagrammed, and every decision is logged.

---

## 13. Growth: How Grace Evolves
- New knowledge is ingested, embedded, and linked to memory.
- Skills and trust weights adapt with experience and feedback.
- Architecture and runbooks are updated as the system grows.

**After reading this, Pawel will understand the entire Grace system: what, where, when, how, and why — at finite detail.**
