# Grace Governance Kernel Security Hardening Guide

This guide outlines best practices and actionable steps for securing your production deployment.

## 1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Define roles and permissions for all API endpoints and internal actions.
- Use JWT or OAuth2 for authentication and authorization.
- Enforce least privilege for all service accounts.

## 2. Encryption
- Enable TLS/SSL for all external API and database connections.
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest (PostgreSQL, Redis, object storage).
- Use environment variables or secret managers for keys and credentials.

## 3. Rate Limiting
- Implement rate limiting on all public API endpoints (e.g., 100 requests/min/user).
- Use middleware or API gateway for enforcement.

## 4. Secrets Management
- Store secrets in a secure vault (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
- Never commit secrets to source control.
- Rotate credentials regularly.

## 5. Network Security
- Restrict inbound traffic to trusted sources only.
- Use firewalls and security groups for all cloud resources.
- Isolate sensitive services on private networks.

## 6. Monitoring & Auditing
- Enable audit logging for all sensitive actions and data changes.
- Monitor logs for suspicious activity and failed access attempts.
- Set up alerting for security events in Prometheus/Grafana.

## 7. Dependency Management
- Regularly update dependencies and scan for vulnerabilities (e.g., `pip-audit`).
- Use automated CI/CD checks for security issues.

## 8. Container Security
- Use minimal base images and run containers as non-root users.
- Scan images for vulnerabilities before deployment.
- Enable seccomp, AppArmor, or SELinux profiles for containers.
