Grace AI Memory Systems - Audit & Integration Report
====================================================

COMPREHENSIVE AUDIT OF MEMORY SYSTEMS
=====================================

This report verifies:
1. All 4 memory systems present
2. All systems are working/active
3. All systems are connected through the architecture
4. Data flows properly through the system


MEMORY SYSTEMS TO VERIFY:
=========================

✓ 1. LIGHTNING MEMORY (Fast/Cache Layer)
     Purpose: Ultra-fast in-memory cache, immediate access
     Expected location: grace/memory/lightning_memory.py
     Status: [TO BE VERIFIED]

✓ 2. FUSION MEMORY (Integrated/Unified Layer)
     Purpose: Fuses multiple memory types together
     Expected location: grace/memory/fusion_memory.py
     Status: [TO BE VERIFIED]

✓ 3. VECTOR MEMORY (Semantic/Embedding Layer)
     Purpose: Semantic similarity search, embeddings
     Expected location: grace/memory/vector_memory.py
     Status: [TO BE VERIFIED]

✓ 4. LIBRARIAN MEMORY (Knowledge/Index Layer)
     Purpose: Structured knowledge organization, indexing
     Expected location: grace/memory/librarian_memory.py
     Status: [TO BE VERIFIED]


AUDIT CHECKLIST:
================

For each system, verify:

□ FILE EXISTS
  - Check if implementation file exists
  - Check if properly formatted Python
  - Check for syntax errors

□ CLASS DEFINED
  - Main class exists (LightningMemory, FusionMemory, VectorMemory, LibrarianMemory)
  - Methods implemented
  - Initialization proper

□ CORE FUNCTIONALITY
  - Store/retrieve operations work
  - Proper data structures
  - Error handling present

□ INTEGRATION POINTS
  - Connected to EventBus
  - Registered in component registry
  - Available through API

□ ACTIVE/WORKING
  - Can be imported without errors
  - Methods are callable
  - Returns expected data types

□ DATA FLOW
  - Input → Processing → Output clear
  - Proper logging
  - Status tracking


INTEGRATION POINTS TO VERIFY:
=============================

□ EventBus Integration
  - Each system publishes events
  - Each system subscribes to relevant events
  - Event names consistent

□ Component Registry
  - All 4 systems registered
  - Accessible via registry.get()
  - Dependencies listed

□ API Endpoints
  - Memory status endpoint
  - Query endpoint for each type
  - Store endpoint for each type

□ Core Truth Layer
  - Memory operations logged to immutable log
  - Metrics tracked in KPIs
  - Trust scores maintained

□ Data Flow Through System
  - Input → Lightning → Fusion → Vector/Librarian
  - Retrieval → Lightning/Fusion → Output
  - Clear read/write paths


CONNECTION DIAGRAM (Expected):
==============================

    API Input
        ↓
    Lightning Memory (Cache)
        ↓
    Fusion Memory (Unified)
        ↓
    ├─→ Vector Memory (Search)
        └─→ Librarian Memory (Index)
        ↓
    Core Truth Layer (Immutable Log)
        ↓
    API Output


NEXT STEPS IN AUDIT:
====================

1. Search for all memory system files
2. Check each file for core classes
3. Verify initialization and methods
4. Test imports
5. Verify integration with event bus
6. Confirm component registry entries
7. Check API endpoints
8. Verify immutable logging
9. Create unified memory interface if needed
10. Document complete data flow


EXPECTED FINDINGS:
==================

If all systems working:
  ✓ 4 memory system files exist
  ✓ 4 main classes implemented
  ✓ All connected to EventBus
  ✓ All registered in component registry
  ✓ All have API endpoints
  ✓ All log to truth layer
  ✓ Data flows smoothly through all layers

Status will be marked:
  ✅ WORKING - System present, active, integrated
  ⚠️ PARTIAL - System present but needs integration
  ❌ MISSING - System not found

AUDIT STATUS: [IN PROGRESS]
