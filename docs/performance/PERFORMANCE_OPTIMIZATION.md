# Grace Governance Kernel Performance Optimization Guide

This guide provides actionable strategies for optimizing performance and scaling Grace Kernel in production.

## 1. Database Query Optimization
- Use indexes on frequently queried fields (e.g., memory_id, content_hash, created_at).
- Profile slow queries with EXPLAIN and optimize SQL statements.
- Batch writes and use connection pooling for high-throughput operations.

## 2. Caching Layer Implementation
- Enable Redis caching for memory recall and decision results.
- Use time-based and event-based cache invalidation.
- Monitor cache hit/miss rates and tune cache size.

## 3. Load Balancing Setup
- Deploy multiple API and worker containers behind a load balancer (e.g., NGINX, Traefik).
- Use Docker Compose `deploy.replicas` or Kubernetes for horizontal scaling.
- Monitor request latency and error rates.

## 4. Asynchronous Processing
- Use Celery or asyncio for background tasks and event-driven workflows.
- Offload heavy computations to worker queues.

## 5. Resource Monitoring & Auto-Scaling
- Track CPU, memory, and I/O usage with Prometheus/Grafana.
- Set up auto-scaling policies based on resource thresholds.

## 6. External Integrations
- Use async HTTP clients for external AI and enterprise service calls.
- Implement retry logic and circuit breakers for reliability.

## Checklist
- [ ] Indexes and query profiling
- [ ] Redis cache enabled and tuned
- [ ] Load balancer configured
- [ ] Async task queues in place
- [ ] Resource monitoring and auto-scaling
- [ ] Robust external integration patterns
