# Bullet-Proof Self-Healing + Multi-OS Offline Remediation

## 1) Non-negotiables (the “bullet-proof” list)

### Detection & Signals
- SLO detectors for: api_p95_ms, error_rate, queue_lag, dlq_depth, cpu_load, mem_pressure, disk_io, net_errors.
- Per-service health model (green/amber/red) with rate-limited alerting.
- Anomaly events standardized: slo.anomaly.detected.v1.

### RCA & Explainability
- RCA correlator (metrics + logs + traces) → rca.hypothesis.v1 with confidence and evidence refs.
- Explainability annotations: EXPLANATION_NL, CAUSAL_CHAIN, COUNTERFACTUALS.

### Three-Layer Consensus
- L1 (File): unit, lint, SAST/dep scan, invariants → l1.consensus.result.v1. Quorum: rule + LLM + security.
- L2 (Subsystem): integration tests, chaos probes, perf budget, compliance veto → l2.consensus.result.v1.
- L3 (Execution): sandbox, governance, blue/green + shadow compare, auto-rollback, KPI/trust/meta-learning.

### Immutable Evidence & Forensics
- Append-only immutable log (hash chain), no edits; all changes via annotations.
- Chain of custody on evidence (hash + signature + actor).
- Incident timeline auto-built from log + annotations.

### Governance & Safety
- Policy bundle (constitutional, data sovereignty, blast-radius caps) enforced before L3 deploy.
- EmergencyPolicyCache (signed snapshot) for read-only operation if governance is down; post-facto ratification required.

### Deployment & Rollback
- Blue/green with shadow comparison; automated rollback on SLO burn within < 60s.
- Rollback artifacts always pre-staged and signed.

### Security
- Per-component short-lived tokens (no system_key), rotation via Vault/Keychain/DPAPI.
- Image/binary signing (cosign/AuthentiCode/macOS codesign) + SBOM; verify before install/launch.
- Secrets never logged; redaction at source.

### Observability
- OpenTelemetry traces: AVN.detect → RCA.infer → L1.vote → L2.vote → Sandbox.run → Governance.validate → Deploy.compare.
- Prom metrics: avn_anomalies_total, rca_confidence_bucket, l1_accept_ratio, deploy_promotions_total, deploy_rollbacks_total, trust_score{component=...}.

### Meta-learning
- KPI deltas → threshold tuning with guardrails (min/max; human veto).
- Skill weights (knowledge pack) adjusted by success; log kpi.trust.update.v1.

### Self-healing the healer
- Weekly synthetic benign patch exercising L1→L2→L3. If failure → auto-repair (restart agents, refresh creds, rebuild runner), then page.
- Fallback detectors (rules-only) if ML detector is down.

## 2) Multi-OS Tie-in (offline, local dependency auto-fix)

### A) Runner Model (single API, OS adapters)

**Runner API (uniform):**
- Runner.apply_patch(artifact|diff)   # code/config/pkg apply (atomic)
- Runner.restart(service)             # safe restart + health probe
- Runner.metrics()                    # normalized probe set
- Runner.rollback(artifact|snapshot)  # atomic revert
- Runner.sandbox(cmd, policy)         # restricted exec on host
- Runner.inventory()                  # versions, checksums, SBOM refs
- Runner.cache_info()                 # local caches & artifact states

- Implement LinuxRunner, WindowsRunner, MacRunner behind this interface.
- All runner actions → immutable log annotations + signed custody entries.

### B) Local Artifacts & Caches (no external dependency)
- Local artifact store per site/host (e.g., file://, SMB share, or internal registry) with:
  - Container images (signed)
  - OS packages (DEB/RPM/MSI/PKG)
  - Language wheels/modules (PyPI wheels, NPM tarballs, Maven jars)
  - Config bundles & migration scripts
- Offline caches warmed nightly: apt/yum, Chocolatey/Winget, Homebrew, pip/npm/maven/gradle.
- Version pinning + lockfiles (pip-tools/poetry, npm lock, Gradle/Maven lock) committed.
- SBOMs stored alongside artifacts; verify hash + signature before use.
- Policy: No outbound downloads during remediation. All installs resolve from local store or are denied.

### C) OS-Specific Hooks

#### Linux
- Services: systemd (systemctl reload|restart), unit drop-ins for overrides.
- Packages: apt/yum/dnf with local repo mirror (deb [trusted=yes] file:/…).
- Kernel/sysctl: write to /etc/sysctl.d/*.conf, apply via sysctl --system.
- Net: nftables/iptables; tc for throttling during shadow tests.
- Sandbox: nsjail/bwrap/firejail or rootless containers (Podman); filesystem overlay for atomic swaps.
- Snapshots: LVM/ZFS/btrfs or app-level snapshot prior to patch.

#### Windows
- Services: SCM (Restart-Service, Get-Service), IIS app pools/sites for web.
- Packages: offline Chocolatey/Winget source; MSIs from local share; PowerShell DSC for desired state.
- Signing: Authenticode verification before install.
- Sandbox: Windows Sandbox or ConstrainedLanguageMode PowerShell for preflight.
- Snapshots: VSS (Volume Shadow Copy) or app snapshot prior to patch.

#### macOS
- Services: launchd plists; launchctl kickstart.
- Packages: Homebrew from local bottle cache; notarized PKGs; codesign verify.
- Sandbox: sandbox-exec or VM/Orka; pfctl for network shaping during tests.
- Snapshots: APFS snapshot before change; easy rollback.

### D) Dependency Auto-Fix (on-device, atomic, reversible)

**Strategy (language stacks):**
- Python: prebuilt wheels in local store; venv per service; pip install --no-index --find-links <local>; atomic symlink flip: venv_current -> venv_YYYYmmddHHMM.
- Node: offline tarballs in local NPM cache; npm ci --offline; atomic dir swap for node_modules.
- JVM: internal Maven proxy (Nexus/Artifactory offline replica); mvn -o or Gradle --offline; classpath pinned.
- Go/Rust: private module/cache mirror; pinned go.sum/Cargo.lock; static binaries signed.

**OS packages & drivers:**
- Use only pre-mirrored repos; apply delta RPM/DEB from local store.
- Validate kernel / driver compatibility by host profile before install.
- Rebootless changes preferred; if reboot needed, schedule with guard window + quorum approval.

**Install flow (uniform):**
1. Plan: resolve from lockfile to exact artifacts (no network).
2. Preflight: dry run install in sandbox; run smoke tests.
3. Apply: atomic overlay/symlink switch; systemd/IIS/launchd restart with health probe.
4. Shadow compare: route a sample of traffic; measure deltas.
5. Commit or rollback quickly on SLO burn.

### E) Trust, Safety & Least-Privilege
- Runner runs under least-priv service account; privilege escalation only for bounded actions (e.g., package install).
- RBAC per action: “may restart X”, “may write /etc/sysctl.d”, “may install package from repo Y”.
- All actions are signed requests from control plane and verified by runner (mutual TLS or OS-native auth).
- Quarantine mode: if patch suspected risky, apply only in sandbox or blue; never on green until governance passes.

### F) Telemetry Normalization (cross-OS)
- Normalize to common keys: cpu_load, mem_used, disk_used, net_error_rate, svc_uptime, svc_restarts.
- Linux exporters (node_exporter + custom), Windows (WMI/PerfCounter exporter), macOS (metricskit or custom agent).
- Trace context propagated from control plane to runners for end-to-end RCA.

### G) Failure Modes & Fallbacks
- No artifact available → auto-defer; raise recommendation: “promote from local mirror first”.
- Signature mismatch → hard stop, governance incident.
- Install partial → rollback using snapshot/symlink; mark artifact “bad”.
- Runner unhealthy → handover to secondary runner; if all down, drop to read-only diagnosis.

### H) Knowledge-Driven Fixes (learn over time)
- Link each dependency incident to knowledge items (playbooks, patterns).
- Successful remediation → increase weight for that playbook/tag, lower for failing ones.
- Periodically re-embed updated knowledge; keep vector DB in sync.

## 3) Minimal Contracts (copy/paste)

### Remediation Request → Runner

```
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "artifact_ref": "local://repo/python/wheels/serviceA-1.2.3.whl",
  "ops": ["apply_patch","restart:serviceA"],
  "preflight": {"sandbox": true, "tests": ["smoke:health","e2e:login"]},
  "rollback": {"artifact": "local://snapshots/serviceA@2025-10-03"},
  "sign": {"algo": "cosign", "digest": "sha256:..."}
}
```

### Runner Result

```
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "status": "success|failed|rolled_back",
  "metrics": {"p95_ms": 240, "error_rate": 0.003},
  "logs_ref": "immutable:log:12345",
  "snapshot": "local://snapshots/serviceA@2025-10-04T12:00",
  "explanation": "Applied wheel offline; shadow stable; committed."
}
```

---

## 4) Acceptance Gates (done = truly hardened)
- Zero outbound during remediation; all artifacts from local store (prove by network deny policy during tests).
- Signed artifacts only; unsigned = blocked.
- Atomic apply + instant rollback verified on all OSes.
- Shadow/blue-green verified across OS adapters.
- Weekly pipeline self-test green; auto-repair tested.
- Governance hard stops proven (policy violation blocks deploy).
- RCA confidence ≥0.75 on top-5 incident classes; explanations human-approved ≥80%.
- Mean rollback time < 60s; mean safe-promotion time < 10m (from anomaly).

---

## 5) What to implement next (fast wins)
- Build local artifact mirror + signing + SBOM store.
- Finish Runner adapters (Linux/Windows/macOS) with sandbox + atomic swap.
- Wire offline installers for Python/Node/JVM; add lockfile enforcement.
- Add snapshot/rollback primitives per OS.
- Enforce network egress deny during remediation CI to prove offline.
- Expand knowledge pack with dependency-specific playbooks (pip cache corruption, npm peer deps, DLL hell, brew bottle pinning).
- Add confidence calibration to RCA (human feedback loop).
- Document break-glass and on-call drills.
