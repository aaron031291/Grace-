# Advanced Governance Features for Grace Kernel

This guide outlines production-ready strategies and implementation notes for advanced governance capabilities.

## 1. Blue/Green Deployment & Shadow Mode
- Use feature flags to enable shadow mode for new governance logic.
- Route a subset of requests to the "green" (test) kernel while keeping "blue" (prod) live.
- Compare decisions and metrics between both kernels for validation.
- Roll out new features gradually and monitor impact.

## 2. Meta-Learning Experience Collection
- Log all governance decisions and feedback for meta-learning.
- Periodically retrain models using collected experience data.
- Integrate feedback loops for continuous improvement.

## 3. Snapshot/Rollback State Management
- Use the `store_snapshot` and `recall_structured_memory` methods in `MemoryCore` for state capture and rollback.
- Automate snapshot creation before major changes or deployments.
- Provide API endpoints for manual and automated rollback.

## 4. Hot-Swap Capability
- Design kernel modules to support live code and config updates without downtime.
- Use container orchestration (Docker Compose, Kubernetes) for rolling updates.
- Monitor health and rollback if issues are detected during hot-swap.

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Feature flags for blue/green and shadow mode
- [ ] Experience logging and feedback integration
- [ ] Automated snapshot/rollback workflows
- [ ] Hot-swap orchestration scripts
