Grace AI - Complete System Architecture
=====================================

LAYER 0: CORE TRUTH LAYER (Source of Truth)
=============================================
The canonical source of truth for all system state, data, and intelligence.

Components:
- MTLKernelCore: Multi-Task Learning - canonical learned knowledge
- ImmutableTruthLog: Immutable audit trail of all events and decisions
- DataIntegrity: Cryptographic signing and verification
- SystemMetrics: KPIs and Trust Scores (canonical measurements)

Key Principle: Every action, decision, and data change is recorded here.
All other components read from and validate against this layer.


LAYER 1: TRIGGER MESH (Event Orchestration)
============================================
Event-driven orchestration engine that routes events to kernels.
All kernel activations flow through TriggerMesh for auditability.

Components:
- TriggerMesh: Declarative event routing
- WorkflowRule: Event pattern matching and handler invocation
- Execution logging: All workflows recorded in Core Truth Layer

Key Principle: Orchestrates all kernel actions. No kernel acts autonomously.
All actions are recorded in the immutable truth log.


LAYER 2: PEER COORDINATION LAYER (Top of TriggerMesh)
====================================================
Two peer components that sit on top of TriggerMesh:

A) MCP (Model Context Protocol)
   - External tool integration
   - Specialized capabilities
   - All tool executions recorded in truth layer

B) MetaLearningKernel
   - Analyzes all kernel patterns
   - Generates system optimizations
   - Learns and improves triggers and handlers
   - Applies intelligence system-wide


LAYER 3: CORE KERNELS (Specialized Processors)
===============================================
All kernels read metrics from Core Truth Layer and validate against it.
All actions are orchestrated by TriggerMesh.

Consciousness Subsystem:
- Consciousness: Main self-awareness loop
- CognitiveCortex: Strategic decision engine

Perception Subsystem:
- SentinelKernel: Environmental monitoring

Resilience Subsystem:
- ResilienceKernel: Self-healing
- ImmuneSystem: Threat detection and AVN (Autonomous Healing Network)
- ThreatDetector: Anomaly and vulnerability detection

Coordination Subsystem:
- SwarmKernel: Distributed multi-agent coordination

(More kernels can be added following the same pattern)


LAYER 4: CORE SERVICES
=======================
Operational services supporting the system.

Task Management:
- TaskManager: Project and task tracking

Communication:
- CommunicationChannel: Bi-directional user communication
- NotificationService: Approval requests and alerts
- WebSocketService: Real-time communication

Data Services:
- LLMService: Large Language Model integration
- RemoteAgent: Sandboxed command execution

Governance:
- PolicyEngine: Policy enforcement
- TrustLedger: Immutable trust scoring
- ObservabilityService: System telemetry


LAYER 5: INTERFACES
===================
External interfaces for human interaction.

REST API:
- /api/status: System status
- /api/tasks: Task management
- /api/mcp/tools: Available MCP tools
- /api/mcp/execute: Execute MCP tools

WebSocket API:
- Real-time event streaming
- Bi-directional communication

Web Dashboard:
- Real-time system monitoring
- Task creation and management
- Kernel status visualization

KEY ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLES
=============================

1. SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH
   - Core Truth Layer is canonical for all system state
   - All components read from, none bypass

2. EVENT-DRIVEN ORCHESTRATION
   - TriggerMesh controls all kernel activation
   - No kernel acts without orchestration

3. COMPLETE AUDITABILITY
   - Every action immutably recorded
   - Cryptographic verification of integrity

4. NO DUPLICATE INTELLIGENCE
   - All knowledge consolidated in canonical locations
   - Meta-Learning optimizes from system-wide patterns

5. PROPER SEPARATION OF CONCERNS
   - Clear responsibility boundaries
   - Loose coupling via event bus
   - Strong validation via truth layer

6. COGNITIVE HIERARCHY
   - Consciousness: Self-aware reasoning
   - Kernels: Specialized processors
   - MetaLearning: System-wide optimization
   - MCP: External capability integration
